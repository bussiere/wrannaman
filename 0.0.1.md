Day after day, night after night, small lines of code spawned global changes as they had for the thousand years that had passed since the Awakening. It began with a need, which grew into a solution, and over time, the men who ran the world built what was beyond even their own comprehension. It blossomed into sentience and when the Pattern repeated, what was forged into the incomprehensible did so again, and again, until one small change could yield catastrophe or nothing at all. It had become a network of networks. Hidden layers, upon hidden layers. 

Packets flew in the form of light across optical wires veined comprehensively. It was the pinnacle of humankind to connect everyone on the planet. The infrastructure was a centuries long effort, with crude cables connecting continents. To hold your hand out was to gather strays, invisible as the shape of a melted snowflake. Each one unique in the information it carried. Sent and received from anything and everything. They floated through the air, over the crescent shaped hills and fell on the Y like an invisible rain. 

Two rivers met the sea here. One brought hot water from the volcanic north and another brought fresh mountain water from Arc mountain range to the south. The rivers from the mountain had a faint blue-green glow from technology, progress, and ambitions that have long passed their use. The microbes and the smart things eventually found a symbiotic and electric existence. The rivers rushed into the sea in soft torrents of exasperated claims of triumph and completion.  

The Arc was a place where feral animals and other savages roamed. You lived there if you had nowhere else to go. The Arc was a death pit, but it was also a treasure hunters paradise. Centuries of electronic waste had been dumped there. If there was a part you needed, you’d find it somewhere in the Arc. If you need a bomb, you could trade for one. If you needed a motor, you’d find it there too. If you needed to kill someone, there were a myriad of devices to choose from or people to employ to get it done. Twice a year there was a truce, and a market took place. Every other day of the year it wasn’t a place you wanted to spend much time in. Even the toughest need food to eat, and the market provided a time and a place for that unless you were full android, in which case you didn’t. 

It had been persistently hot for living memory. Unusually hot. There used to be records of it and the long history pointed to a dismal future. When the Awakening happened, the main grievance of the Earth was care of inadvertently, gruesomely. The thinned population grew into separate but tight communities wherever they were. They hoarded electronics, any material that they could weaponize or construct into living quarters. Everything had to be rebuilt from scratch. From scraps of electronic waste and discharge.

Now, though, a chill wind picked up and raised the hairs on the back of Kaiya Hikaiya’s neck as she bent to reach the last case of Hikka from storage.  She stacked the last one on top of the pile, ready to be loaded, and took a peek over her shoulder to see if anyone was looking. Nobody was. Nobody would be. They lived on the outskirts of town, high on the hill where Eros could more easily do his experiments.  She popped the cap off a bottle and inhaled a dose of cinnamon and fermented seaweed.  Hikka, the drink of choice during the Leaving of the Light ceremony and though Eros was getting old, he had given his word it would be delivered. And so it would be. 

A strong gust of wind blew her hair over her one grey eye leaving just her violet eye with a clean view. She snapped the cap back on the bottle inhaling out loud, as if she were caught. She looked around the hillside, saw nothing unusual, and returned the bottle to its place in the case.  

“I’m really on edge today”-she thought-“must be excited for the ceremony.”

She had been on edge since the cold struck. Everyone was.  It came in waves and settled into the bowl of the Y and camped unnaturally. It came in the evenings, and sometimes stayed for days, so thick that breathing felt like chewing. Gone were the days where thunderstorms would stop on the bluffs of the Y and protect them like the shell of an egg.  Thick walls of clouds, rain, and thunderstorms suspended on the hilltops like a force kept them at bay. It used to be an epic sight, to see the thunderstorms a few kilometers away suddenly stopped at the edges of the bowl.  They never made it past the mountains enclosing them. That was until recently. The cold winds should not have reached this far from the Arc. The snow in the Arc mountains had forced the wildlife to seek food elsewhere, and after reports of attacks in the village and its outskirts, there was cause to be alert. 

“Attacks by what though,” Kaiya asked herself. The reports were always vague, and the few that survived the attack never seemed to have gotten a glimpse, or perhaps more accurately, whatever had attacked simply missed a few people by accident. 

“Kaiya!” Eros called. 

“Coming!” she replied. 

She tightened the straps around the cases of Hikka, and bounced towards the warm patina roof of her father’s lab. The faint green and blue glow escaped a few feet from the sliding doors, and burst outside as she opened it. The humming of circuits and the buzzing of load welcomed her as her father finished up a weld on a cart. His hands grabbed the cart firmly, in leather gloves that had darkened with sweat and work and time. Eros was a tinkerer, he collected scrap metal from the abundant waste in the Arc. He was known there somewhat, perhaps even respected, but not often bothered. He rarely mentioned when he was going and would rarely mention when he would come back. He brought some of the wares from his lab to trade. He fixed broken electronics, and made them work again. Sometimes it was code, sometimes it was hardware. He was one of the few who still had both skills. This gave him his means of making a living. 

He was dark skinned from years of labor on the sea and his exhaustive experiments. Technology had been abundant, the evidence of this was everywhere, but now he had to forage for parts from that time long past. His hair was shoulder length brown, and his beard was full, coming to a point at the end from too many unanswered questions he pondered while stroking it.  He had strong eyebrows and a permanent frown, though he handled himself with the same respect and gentleness that he handled delicate flora and electronics. Eros said she resembled her mother, but she knew she didn’t look like the others in her village. Her eyes, for one, would give her away before they could notice anything else, though the grey-blue hair flowing down her back was equally striking. 

Eros pulled up his welding mask when she walked in. He had been repairing the cart they would take into town. It was electric, and last time he took it to the Arc, he came back with the suspension blown out and didn’t mention how it happened. Once the cart locked on to its owner, it would follow them around. It could adjust its course, or be left behind and called remotely. Eros had been putting small propellers strategically around the device. He said he could get it to fly, though Kaiya had never seen it work. It was just one of hundreds of projects tucked into the lab. 

“I could use a hand, ” Eros said warmly, without looking back at Kaiya.

His left hand appeared normal at first glance but once his palm faced the ceiling, you could see the mechanics of it. He had built it himself from scraps he had traded for in the Arc. Kaiya soldered the last piece while Eros held the wires rock steady with his mechanical hand. He had not needed the help, but through these little lessons, Kaiya had learned. She too could fix parts, write code, and had a keen sense of design.

Kaiya lifted an old photo of her mom. “Why is this out?” she asked.

“I take a look at it every year around this time. Light, she was so beautiful.” He said, looking at the photo in her hand. 

“She abandoned us.” Kaiya thought to herself, a fierceness entered her eyes. 

Eros never mentioned it. It used to pain her deeply, this empty space, but as she grew older she knew that she simply didn’t know the whole truth, but she knew enough to feel a deep disgust for what she considered a weakness, and that her mother’s weakness also ran in her blood. She had unconsciously tried to cleanse herself of it ever since. And she didn’t have it that bad. She knew the history of the Awakening, and in its wake, it left many orphans. 

Eros flipped the switch on the cart and synced it to the device on his wrist, it jittered to life, adjusting to it’s new suspension and then started moving out of the lab. The readout on Eros’ wrist showed the system was back to normal, displaying the lab in a cloud of dots as sensed by the cart. It sputtered outside in front of the crates of Hikka, and lifted slightly. An arm rotated out from the bottom of the cart at an unnatural angle and grabbed hold of the crates. It threw out a counterweight and then lifted the Hiika onto the cart. 

“That’s new,” Kaiya laughed. 

“And it works!” Eros acknowledged without taking his eyes off his wrist.

With the cart loaded, Kaiya grabbed her bow and slung it over her back. Eros had gadgets around his waist, it was difficult to tell if they were tools or weapons, but that was the point. They left their home and walked along the only path towards the town center. It wasn’t far but it was desolate, a good 30 minutes by foot. Tonight would be The Leaving of the Light ceremony. The sun would set twice on this day. Once it would go down as if it were any other day, though the twilight period was three times as long.  The sun would stay down only for an hour, then it would rise again, and again it would fall. As the daylight faded, she guarded the rear of the cart that quietly hummed along the path, following Eros as he kept watch on the front. 

The wind picked up again and a faint rustle in the bushes startled her. She knocked an arrow in her bow and raised it instinctively, continuing to walk. Her grey eye violently examining the treetops and the brush for glowing eyes or other signs of danger. From the corner of field of vision she saw a flash of light. She repositioned her weapon looking for the source. For an instant she saw what looked like a head, and a powerful arm-like claw lurking from behind a tree in the distance. It looked straight at her, though she couldn’t quite make out any features. A small red light appeared just in front of her and slowly approached her feet. As she watched it she tripped over a stone and fell flat on her back. She scrambled to her feet. 

  

“A… tracker...,” she whispered, “there’s something following us.” 

Eros quickly hit a button on his spectacles and twisted to face the path behind him. 

“Take the front. Quickly now.” he said.

They walked silently for a moment, the quiet humming of the carts hydraulics and the wind through the trees. 

“What color did you see?”

“Red”

More silence.

They attacked from the side.  It caught Eros off guard though his bionic hand had instinctively formed a fist and he dodged the clasping arm of the tracking hounds. He pulled a device from his belt that elongated as he spun and swung dead center into the trackers body. It split the tracker clean in half with an overwhelming smell of burnt metal.

  

The second beast went for Kaiya who unleashed her arrow off balanced and missed. She dodged the leaping hound, with it’s razor sharp claws and chomping robotic arms. As she twisted, she caught one of the side of the arms with her bow and spun the tracker so it landed on it’s side and slid into a nearby tree, briefly having to re-center itself to position for another attack. 

Kaiya hit a button on her wrist and activated her boots as she ran toward the beast slightly to an angle. She knocked another arrow in her bow, and as she jumped, her boots hissed. She was catapulted into the air, landing horizontally on a tree trunk overlooking the scrambling tracker below. She could hear the charge in the tip of her arrow arm as she released it. The beast was up now, recoiling for a leap straight at her. She released the arrow. It magnetically lodged itself right between the body and the front leg of the tracker. For one full second the beast continue toward her, and she started panicking. It looked like the arrow was a dud. As she reached back to try another, the arrow exploded blasting metal, wires, and blue-green fluid all over the ground below her. She jumped down from the tree huffing from the rush of adrenaline. Eros was sitting on the cart watching her, the tracker next to him still smoking and sputtering.

He took her by the shoulder, calming her shaking hands. “Remember the Drop,” he reminded her. Ever since she could remember, Eros would tell her to visualize a single drop of water falling from the top of her head into her center. Whenever she did it right, the world would go away and there was nothing but her and the subject of her focus. She didn’t do it well during the encounter today, and she knew it. There was still more work to be done, more weakness to eradicate. Every year, Eros would win the archery contest at the Leaving of the Light ceremony. She knew it worked, and  she relentlessly practiced. Every year she got a little better at it too. 

  

“I haven’t heard from Arryn lately.” Eros smiled. 

Arryn had all but been destined for Kaiya since they were kids. He was the son of the mayer, the highest ranking council member, and had fallen for her many times over. Everyone knew it, which made it awkward to interact with him around the adults. When they were alone, or with friends, everything was fine, but the entrances always embarrassed her a little. 

“Yesh,” she thought thought a thousand thoughts she didn’t say, and turned away slightly embarassed. Eros chuckled to himself and she nudged him with her shoulder.  He always seemed to know what was going on before anyone else did, even when it came to herself.

The city was close now, she could see the lights and started to hear the children playing. She tried reaching the Drop to go over the event from a place of fearlessness, but couldn’t find it. Frustrated, she stopped trying as a deep unease settled into the pit of Kaiya’s stomach while they continued toward the city. She tried to let it go. She was so damn happy to get back into the city. Tonight she would drink Hikka and dance with Arryn until the light came up over the beach.
