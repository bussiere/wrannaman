Day after day, night after night, small lines of code spawned global changes as they had for the thousand years that had passed since the Awakening. It began with a need, which grew into a solution, and over time, the men who ran the world built what was beyond even their own comprehension. It blossomed into sentience and when the Pattern repeated, what was forged into the incomprehensible did so again, and again, until one small change could yield catastrophe or nothing at all. It had become a network of networks. Hidden layers, upon hidden layers. 

Packets flew in the form of light across optical wires veined comprehensively. It was the pinnacle of humankind to connect everyone on the planet. The infrastructure was a centuries long effort, with crude cables connecting continents. To hold your hand out was to gather strays, invisible as the shape of a melted snowflake. Each one unique in the information it carried. Sent and received from anything and everything. They floated through the air, over the crescent shaped hills and fell on the Y like an invisible rain. 

Two rivers met the sea here. One brought hot water from the volcanic north and another brought fresh mountain water from Arc mountain range to the south. The rivers from the mountain had a faint blue-green glow from technology, progress, and ambitions that have long passed their use. The microbes and the smart things eventually found a symbiotic and electric existence. The Arc was a place where feral animals and other savages roamed. You lived there if you had no choice. The tropical microclimate of the Y and the chilling Arc could not have been more opposite. The rivers rushed into the sea in soft torrents of exasperated claims of triumph and completion. 

It had been persistently hot for living memory. Unusually hot. There used to be records of it and the long history pointed to a dismal future. When the Awakening happened, the main grievance of the Earth was care of inadvertently, gruesomely. The thinned population grew into separate but tight communities wherever they were. They hoarded electronics, any material that they could weaponize or construct into living quarters. Everything had to be rebuilt from scratch. From scraps of electronic waste and discharge.

Now, though,  a chill wind picked up and raised the hairs on the back of Kaiya Hikaiya’s neck as she bent to reach the last case of Hikka from storage.  She plopped the last one on the cart and took a peek over her shoulder to see if anyone was looking. Nobody was. Nobody would be. They lived on the outskirts of town, high on the hill where Eros could more easily do his experiments.  She popped the cap off a bottle and inhaled a dose of cinnamon and fermented seaweed.  Hikka is the drink of choice during the Leaving of the Light ceremony and though Eros was getting old, he had given his word it would be delivered. So deliver it, they would. 

A strong gust of wind blew her hair over her one grey eye and her one violet eye. She snapped the cap back on the bottle inhaling out loud, as if she were caught. She looked around the hillside, saw nothing unusual, and returned the bottle to its place in the case.  

“I’m really on edge today”-she thought-“must be excited for the ceremony.”

She had been on edge since the cold struck. Everyone was.  It came in waves and settled into the bowl of the Y and camped unnaturally. It came in the evenings, and sometimes stayed for days, so thick that breathing felt like chewing. Gone were the days where thunderstorms would stop on the bluffs of the Y and protect them like the shell of an egg.  Thick walls of clouds, rain, and thunderstorms surrounded them. It used to be an epic sight, to see the thunderstorms a few kilometers away suddenly stopped at the top of the bowl, like a force held them back.  They never made it past the mountains enclosing them. The cold winds should not have reached this far from the Arc. The snow in the Arc mountains had forced the wildlife to seek food elsewhere, and after reports of attacks in the village and its outskirts, there was cause to be alert. 

“Kaiya!” Eros called. 

“Coming!” she replied. 

She tightened the straps on the cart and bounced inside the lab. She didn’t look like him at all except for his height. He was dark skinned from years of labor on the sea and his exhaustive experiments. Technology had been abundant, the evidence of this was everywhere, but now he had to forage for parts from that time long past. His hair was a shoulder length brown, and his beard was full, coming to a point at the end from too many unanswered questions he pondered while stroking it.  He had strong eyebrows and a permanent frown, though he handled himself with the same respect and gentleness that he handled delicate flora and electronics. Eros said she resembled her mother, but she knew she didn’t look like the others in her village. Her eyes, for one, would give her away before they could notice anything else, though the grey-blue hair flowing down her back was equally striking. 

Eros pulled up his welding mask when she walked in. He had been repairing the cart they would take into town. “I could use a hand, ” Eros said warmly. His left hand appeared normal at first glance but once his palm faced the sky, you could see the mechanics of it. He had built it himself from scraps he had found around the Y. Some were carried in from the Arc river. Kaiya soldered the last piece while Eros held the wires rock steady with his mechanical hand. He had not needed the help, but through these little instructions, Kaiya had learned about engineering. 

Kaiya lifted an old photo of her mom. “Why is this out?” she asked.

“I take a look at it every year around this time. Light, she was so beautiful.” He said, looking at the photo in her hand. 

“She abandoned us, you speak of her as if she didn’t.” Kaiya said, a fierceness entered her eyes. 

“Kaiya-”

“She left dad, times got tough and she abandoned us when it got too hard for her. That goes against everything you’ve ever taught me.” Kaiya was almost to tears. She fought them back as Eros reached for her and gave her a hug. “Your mother loved you very much. That I know for sure. The rest is hard to say. It was a complicated time for both of us.” Kaiya realized she didn’t know the whole truth but she knew enough to feel a deep disgust for what she considered a weakness, and that her mother’s weakness also ran in her blood. She had unintentionally tried to cleanse herself of it ever since.

They left their home and walked along the path towards the town center. It wasn’t far but it was desolate. The Leaving of the Light ceremony began in the dark. The sun would set twice on this day. Once it would go down as if it were any other day, but only for an hour, then it would rise again, and again it would fall. As the day quickly became night she guarded the rear of the cart that quietly hummed along the path, following Eros as he kept watch on the front. 

The wind picked up again and a faint rustle in the bushes startled her. She knocked an arrow in her bow and raised it instinctively, continuing to walk. Her grey eye violently examining the treetops and the brush for glowing eyes or other signs of danger. From the corner of field of vision she saw a flash of light. She repositioned her weapon looking for the source. For an instant she saw what looked like a head, and a powerful arm-like claw lurking from behind a tree in the distance. It looked straight at her, though she couldn’t quite make out any features. A small red light appeared just in front of her and slowly approached her feet. As she watched it she tripped over a stone and fell flat on her back. She scrambled to her feet. 

  

“A… thing...,” she whispered, “there’s something following us.” Eros quickly hit a button on his spectacles and twisted to face the path behind him. 

“Take the front. Quickly now” he said. 

  

They walked wordlessly for minutes and the cart picked up it’s speed. “I don’t see anything,” he said, “could it have been a trick of the mind?” No she thought, this was real. “I thought I saw some kind of light coming towards me, aiming at me almost,” she thought out loud. Eros took her by the shoulder, calming her shaking hands. “Remember the Drop,” he reminded her. Nobody else talked like Eros did. Ever since she could remember, Eros would tell her to visualize a single drop of water falling from the top of her head into her center. Whenever she did it right, the world would go away and there was nothing but her and the subject of her focus. Every year, Eros would win the archery contest with his Drop, so she continued to practice and every year she got a little better at it too. 

These were strange times in the Y and she needed all the help she could get. She could have sworn there was a red light from somewhere coming at her, but with all the fluorescent creatures in the area, she knew it was possible that it was just her imagination. 

  

“I haven’t heard from Arryn lately.” Eros smiled. Arryn had all but been promised to Kaiya since they were kids. He was the son of the a high council member and had fallen for her many times over. Everyone knew it, which made it awkward to interact with him around the adults. When they were alone, or with friends, everything was fine, but the entrances always embarrassed her a little. “It will be good to be around him,” she thought. He always seemed to know what was going on. Maybe he would know what the red light was. “I’m sure he’s been busy with the ceremony,” She said. “That must be it,” Eros chided. 

  

The city was close now, she could see the lights and started to hear the children playing. She tried reaching the Drop to go over the event from a place of fearlessness, but couldn’t find it. Frustrated, she stopped trying as a deep unease settled into the pit of Kaiya’s stomach while they continued toward the city. She tried to let it go. She was so damn happy to get back into the city. Tonight she would drink Hikka and dance with Arryn until the light came up over the beach.
